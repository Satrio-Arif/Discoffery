Health benefits, disadvantages, and more\r\n', 'When people think of coffee, they usually think of its ability to provide an energy boost. However, according to some research, it can also offer some other important health benefits. Such benefits may include a lower risk of liver cancer, type 2 diabetes, and heart failure.\r\n\r\nWorldwide, experts estimate that people consume around 2.25 billion cups of coffee per day. Researchers have looked at the benefits of drinking coffee for conditions such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, inflammatory bowel disease, and liver disease. There is evidence to support some, but not all, of these claims.\r\n\r\nCoffee contains a number of useful nutrients, including riboflavin (vitamin B2), niacin (vitamin B3), magnesium, potassium, and various phenolic compounds, or antioxidants. Some experts suggest that these and other ingredients in coffee can benefit the human body in various ways.\r\n\r\nHealth benefits of drinking coffee\r\nCoffee may help protect against type 2 diabetes. In 2014, researchers who gathered data on over 48,000 people found that those who increased their coffee consumption by at least one cup per day over 4 years had an 11% lower risk of type 2 diabetes than those who did not increase their intake. A 2017 meta-analysis concluded that people who drank four to six cups of either caffeinated or decaffeinated coffee each day appeared to have a lower risk of metabolic syndrome, including type 2 diabetes.\r\n\r\nCoffee and Parkinson’s Disease\r\nVarious studies have suggested that caffeine, which is present in coffee and many other beverages, may help protect against Parkinson’s disease. One team concluded that men who drink over four cups of coffee per day might have a fivefold lower risk of Parkinson’s disease than those who do not.\r\nThe findings of the 2017 meta-analysis suggested a link between coffee consumption and a lower risk of Parkinson’s disease, even among people who smoke. This team also found that people who drink coffee may be less likely to experience depression and cognitive conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease. However, there was not enough evidence to prove that drinking decaffeinated coffee helps prevent Parkinson’s disease.\r\n\r\nCoffee and Chronic Liver Disease or Cancer\r\n	In 2019, a literature review concluded that coffee intake is likely to reduce the risk of liver cancer. Earlier, in 2015, a cohort study of a multiethnic population in the United States suggested that depending on the dose, consuming two to three cups of coffee daily reduced the participants’ risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma and chronic liver disease (CLD) by 38% and 46%Trusted Source, respectively.\r\nThe meta-analysis from 2017 also concluded that consuming any type of coffee appears to reduce the risk of liver cancer, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and cirrhosis. These findings are now bolstered by a 2021 studyTrusted Source suggesting that consuming all types of coffee may offer some protection against CLD.\r\n\r\nCoffee and Other Liver Diseases\r\n	People who consume coffee may also have a lower risk of gallstone disease. In 2014, researchers looked at coffee consumption among people with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) and primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC). These are autoimmune conditions that affect the bile ducts in the liver.\r\nThey found that people with PSC were more likelyTrusted Source to have a lower coffee intake than those without the condition. There was no evidence to suggest that coffee intake was different among people with or without PBC.\r\nAlso, another 2014 study suggested a link between coffee consumption and a lower risk of dying from nonviral hepatitis-related cirrhosis. The researchers suggested that drinking two or more cups of coffee every day might reduce the risk by 66%Trusted Source.\r\n\r\nCoffee and Heart Health\r\n	The 2017 meta-analysis found that caffeine consumption may have at least a small benefit for cardiovascular health, including blood pressure. In a 2018 study, researchers found that drinking three to five cups of coffee per day may reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease by 15%. Drinking one to five cups daily also seemed to be associated with lower overall mortality resulting from any cause.\r\nFor those people who have already experienced a heart attack, drinking coffee does not appear to increase their risk of experiencing another or dying as a result. The 2017 meta-analysis, however, also found that there may be higher levels of blood lipids (fat) and cholesterol in people who consume more coffee. These substances may predispose a person to heart problems.\r\n\r\nCoffee and Obesity\r\n	There is some evidence suggesting that consuming coffee may help people lose weight. One 2018 paper indicated that the more coffee the participants drank, the higher their mean reduction in weight, body mass index (BMI), and fat mass.\r\nA 2019 study suggested that drinking coffee may have a modest association with weight loss, with a greater association in men than in women. However, these results have not been replicated, so they may not be definitive. Although coffee may provide some benefits in reducing obesity, it is not a substitute for eating a balanced diet and exercising often.\r\n\r\nNutritional value\r\nOne hundred milliliters (about 3.3 ounces [oz]) of regular black coffee (without milk or cream) is low in calories. That is about one typical cup of black coffee, and it only contains around 2 calories. However, adding cream or sugar will increase the calorific value. Coffee beans also contain polyphenols, which are a type of antioxidant. Antioxidants can help protect the body against free radical damage. Free radicals are a type of waste product that the body naturally produces as a result of certain processes.\r\n\r\nFree radicals act as toxins in the body and may cause inflammation. Scientists have found links between inflammation and various aspects of metabolic syndrome, including type 2 diabetes and obesity. In 2018, some researchers suggested that the antioxidant content of coffee may offer protection from metabolic syndrome. Although scientists can prove that certain compounds are present in coffee beans, it remains unclear what happens to them once they enter the human body.\r\n', 'https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/270202'),
(2, 'Americano: What It Is, Recipe, and How to Order It at Starbucks\r\n', 'Americano is a caffeinated drink made with espresso and hot water. It’s basically espresso diluted in water so it’s similar to brewed coffee made in a coffee machine. Americanos are a way to enjoy espresso without the intensity of a straight shot.There is no set amount of water needed to call it an Americano. if you add water to an espresso, it’s an Americano. An Americano can be made with a single or a double shot of espresso. Americanos are believed to have become popular during World War II when American soldiers were in Europe and wanted a drink that mimicked brewed coffee. Some cultures have different terms for similar drinks, like a long black, which is an Australian drink closely related to an Americano.\r\n\r\nDiffrences Between Americano and Regular Black Coffee\r\nEspresso/Coffee\r\nAmericano is made with espresso and black brewed coffee is made in a coffee/drip machine. Americanos have a noticeably heavier body and richer flavor. If you’re unsure of the strength of your Americano, ask you barista how many shots of espresso are included in the drink.\r\nMilk\r\nMilk can be added to Americanos and black coffee.\r\nDrink size\r\nAmericanos are generally ordered in the same sizes as you would order regular black coffee: between 12 and 20 ounces.\r\nCrema\r\nSome Americanos might have a crema on top from the espresso. Because espresso is extracted using pressure, a layer of crema might form at the top, which you won’t see in brewed coffee. \r\nAmericanos At Starbucks\r\nAt Starbucks, Americanos come in four sizes: short (off-the-menu size), tall, grande, and venti.Each size drink comes with a different number of shots. The short size has one, the tall has two, the grande has three, and the venti four. You can customize your Americano to have more or fewer shots depending on your preferences. \r\n\r\nWhat You’ll Need?\r\nEspresso machine\r\nAmericanos are made using an espresso machine but you can use any type of machine that extracts coffee using pressure like a Nespresso.\r\nCoffee grinder\r\nOnly needed if your machine doesn’t come with a grinder.\r\nWhole coffee beans\r\nGet any coffee labeled as “espresso” or your favorite coffee beans.\r\nFiltered water\r\nThis drink is mostly water so you want to use the best quality water you can.\r\n\r\nHow to Make an Americano at Home?\r\nPour hot water into a mug.\r\nLeave room for the espresso.\r\nPull 1-2 shots of espresso.\r\nGrind coffee and use an espresso machine (or Nespresso or Keurig) to extract espresso. You can pull the shot directly into the mug or into a small cup and pour on top of the hot water.\r\nBARISTA’S TIP: You want to fill the cup or mug with hot water first, then add the espresso so that the crema (espresso froth) can sit on top.\r\n\r\nExpert Tips\r\nAny coffee shop with an espresso machine can make an Americano—some places might not have it on the menu, but if you order it, most baristas will know how to make it.\r\nAmericanos are popular drinks in the United States but they’re not as common abroad, so you might need to explain exactly what you want if you’re ordering outside of the U.S.\r\nThere is no standard with the number of shots in an Americano but most coffee shops will make it with two shots.\r\nAn Americano can also refer to a cocktail made with Campari, sweet vermouth, and club soda. It’d be rare to get these two confused, but if you’re ordering coffee for brunch you might need to clarify which drink you mean. \r\n\r\nQuestions You May Have\r\nHow much caffeine is in an Americano?\r\nAn Americano with a double shot of espresso has about 60 mg of caffeine, which is roughly the same amount of caffeine as a 6 ounce cup of coffee (about 71 mg).\r\nWhat is a double or triple Americano? \r\nThe number in front of the Americano refers to the number of espresso shots in the drink. A double Americano will have two shots, a triple will have three, and so on. A coffee shop that’s not Starbucks will usually make an Americano with double shots of espresso.\r\nDoes an Americano have milk? \r\nWhen you order an Americano, it will not come with milk. You can add milk afterwards, like you would to brewed coffee or you can ask for steamed milk. The drink will still be an Americano. \r\nCan you make an Americano with a Keurig? \r\nYup, there are k-cups specifically labelled as Americanos. If you have a Keurig designed to make espresso-based drinks, you can make Americanos.\r\nCan you make an Americano with a Nespresso? \r\nDefinitely. Nespresso machines are designed to produce common espresso-based drinks and Americanos are simple and easy to make on these machines. \r\nHow can I make an iced Americano?\r\nTo make the drink iced, just add espresso to a cup with ice and cold water. The cold water will instantly chill the hot espresso.\r\n', 'https://coffeeatthree.com/americano/'),

(4, 'What is the difference between espresso and drip coffee?\r\n', '­The main differences between espresso coffee and drip coffee are the fineness of the grind and the brewing time. The brewing time for espresso coffee is much shorter, made possible by espresso machines that generate up to 15 atmospheres (ATM) of pressure to force the water through the coffee.\r\n\r\nA shot of espresso is made by forcing about 1.5 ounces of nearly boiling water through tightly packed, finely ground espresso coffee. If everything goes well, what comes out is a dark brown, slightly thick liquid with a small amount of crema (a foam, sort of like the head on a beer) on top.\r\n\r\nThere are many variables in the process of making a shot of espresso. The temperature of the water, the pressure of the water, the fineness of the ground coffee and how tightly the coffee is packed are just a few.\r\n\r\nEspresso coffee is a blend of several different types of coffee beans from different countries. The beans are roasted until they are dark and oily-looking.\r\n\r\nThe beans are ground very finely -- much finer than for drip coffee. The consistency is almost like powdered sugar. The more finely the coffee is ground, the slower the espresso comes out. Generally, for the best shot of espresso, it should take about 25 seconds for the water to pass through the coffee. Sometimes, the consistency of the grind is adjusted to control the brewing time.\r\n\r\nDrip coffee is made by dripping boiling water over ground coffee, which is ground more coarsely than espresso coffee. The water filters through the coffee and falls into a pot. This process is slower than the espresso process, and hot water is in contact with the ground coffee for much longer. Surprisingly, a cup of drip coffee has more caffeine than a shot of espresso.\r\n', 'https://recipes.howstuffworks.com/question645.htm '),
(5, 'Whole Beans vs. Ground Coffee: Which Is Right for You?', 'Pre-ground and whole bean coffee each come with pros and cons. Everything from your home coffee maker to your personal tastes should inform this make-or-day break decision. Here are some other factors to consider when choosing between whole coffee beans and ground coffee.\r\n\r\nWhole Beans Cafe\r\n\r\nPros: Pronounced Flavor, Subtle Complexity\r\n\r\nWhole bean coffee keeps its freshness and flavor longer if its stored properly. If you cherish the full sensory experience of a delicious black coffee above all else, whole beans are the answer.\r\n\r\nA coffee’s taste and aroma come from the oil coating the whole bean. Once coffee beans are ground up, those essential oils begin evaporating and your coffee begins losing freshness and flavor.\r\n\r\nTaste a cup of coffee brewed from pre-ground coffee, then taste a cup of coffee brewed from freshly ground beans. That pronounced flavor? That subtle complexity? That’s the whole bean coffee difference. And when you pair a delicious whole bean coffee with a good coffee bean grinder, things really get brewing.\r\n\r\nPre-ground coffees are typically packaged with a uniform, medium-fine consistency for the typical home coffee maker. Brew coffee with grounds that are too fine or large and your morning cup’s flavor is going south in a hurry. Grinding your own whole beans means you make the coffee that best suits your home brewer.\r\n\r\nUse a coarse grind for your French press. Use an extra fine grind for brewing espresso. No matter your coffee mojo, grinding your own whole bean coffee means no more bitter or sour coffee because your coffee grounds are too large or small for your home coffee maker.\r\n\r\nCons: Time is money\r\n\r\nThe only real downside to using whole bean coffee is the slight learning curve. It may take some time to achieve the ideal coarseness every time you grind. Cleaning your burr grinder might add a few minutes to your morning routine that you can’t afford to spend. \r\nGround Coffee\r\n\r\nPros: Easy to Make, Lots to Choose From\r\n\r\nPre-ground coffee trades whole bean coffee’s nuanced flavor and longevity for ease of use. Third-wave coffee hounds might notice a difference, but here’s the thing. For the Average Java Joe, the dip in quality from your standard whole bean coffee to store-bought ground coffee isn’t world-shattering.\r\n\r\nPre-ground coffee saves you time and mental energy. The risk of brewing a bitter or sour pot of coffee by mistake is much lower than grinding and brewing whole bean coffee. Just scoop enough coffee grounds into the filter, load your home coffee maker, and you’re off to the caffeine races.\r\n\r\nAnother benefit of ground coffee is the sheer number of options available on store shelves. This factor is based in stone cold economics more than anything, but it’s worth pointing out. Coffee drinkers buy more ground coffee than whole bean coffee, so brands produce coffee that caters to those coffee drinkers’ needs. That means more exciting flavors and roasts for ground coffee fans to choose from.\r\n\r\nCons: Close, But Not Quite\r\n\r\nThe biggest knocks on ground coffee are those slight differences in flavor and freshness. And don’t go crazy with the coffee scooper. Brewing too much coffee at once can lead to a leftover pot of stale joe. But if you want a delicious cup of no-fuss coffee, you can’t go wrong with a bag of pre-ground coffee.\r\n\r\nPick up the flavored coffee that was simply meant to be. This power couple of sweet cherry and slinky chocolate flavors went on a double date with our house blend of Central American Arabica beans. Our Sweetheart Blend ground coffee makes your morning mug as simple and elegant as true love’s first kiss.\r\n\r\nSo what will it be? Whole bean or ground coffee?\r\n\r\nWhole beans take the coffee cake for subtle flavor, complexity, and freshness. Ground coffee comes through with its ease of use an array of options.\r\n\r\nNo matter what kind of coffee you choose, let’s not forget: your morning routine is a little sweeter with a cup of coffee.\r\n', 'https://www.barniescoffee.com/blogs/blog/whole-beans-vs-ground-coffee');
