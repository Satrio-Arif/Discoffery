## Get To Know More About Our Model
In this application we build two model of machine learning. One for image classification, and one others for price prediction. In image classification model, we use pre-trained model from EfficientNet. For the price prediction features we use Bidirectional LSTM model.

## Dataset
* Dataset for Image Classification can be found in [this drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1g94VBumJjMcmNvKAiGx5y7En8cPJiYup)
* Dataset for Price Prediction can be found in [this drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MAZAavEMYcS7kb0aLHd7A9mpiq1kd8rw/view)

## How To Use
1. Open our model in github
2. After the code rendered, search open in colab button to run the model in google colab
3. Duplicate the file opened in google colab to your google drive
4. Now you can run it!!

Don't forget to read the comments in every cell on google colab :)
